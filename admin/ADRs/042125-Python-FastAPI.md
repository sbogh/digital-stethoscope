# Architecture Decision Record: Use of Python and FastAPI for Backend Development

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 04-21-25

## 1. Context

As part of our digital stethoscope system, we require a backend to support a variety of services including device communication, data processing, and integration with our frontend application. This backend must be lightweight, fast, easy to develop and maintain, and suitable for handling future data-intensive tasks such as audio analysis and machine learning.

Our team considered several backend technologies across different languages and frameworks before selecting a final stack.

## 2. Decision

We have chosen to build our backend using **Python** with the **FastAPI** framework.

## 3. Rationale

FastAPI and Python offer a strong combination of developer speed, performance, and extensibility, particularly given our current and future needs:

- **Developer familiarity**: Python is a widely known and accessible language for our team, enabling rapid development and iteration.
- **Performance**: FastAPI is built on Starlette and uses asynchronous request handling (via `async/await`), making it fast enough for our use case.
- **Scalability**: The framework is lightweight and modular, making it easy to scale components independently as the system grows.
- **ML and audio processing readiness**: Since much of our potential data analysis and potential machine learning work will be in Python, it makes sense to keep the backend in the same ecosystem for smooth integration.
- **Community and ecosystem**: FastAPI has strong community support and is increasingly used in production systems.

## 4. Consequences

**Positive outcomes:**
- Rapid backend development and easy onboarding for new developers
- Clean, auto-documented API surface for frontend and hardware integration
- Aligned with future machine learning and audio processing pipelines
- Modular and scalable architecture

**Negative outcomes:**
- Python is not as performant as lower-level languages for high-throughput systems (though FastAPI mitigates this with async support)
- Deployment and concurrency need to be handled carefully
- Potential for tighter coupling to Python-based tooling in the long term

## 5. Alternatives Considered

- **Node.js with Express**: Popular and lightweight, but less aligned with our ML pipeline and developer expertise.
- **Django**: Too heavy and opinionated for our needs; we preferred the minimalism and flexibility of FastAPI.

## 6. Related Decisions

- Integration with Firebase for authentication and database (see Firebase ADR)
- Future ADR may cover containerization and deployment strategy (e.g., Docker + CI/CD pipeline)
