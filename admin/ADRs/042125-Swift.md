# Architecture Decision Record: Use of Swift and SwiftUI for Frontend Development

**Status**: Accepted

## 1. Context

As part of our digital stethoscope project, we need a user-facing application to allow healthcare professionals to access and interact with audio recordings. The frontend must be intuitive, responsive, and designed with the needs of our target users in mind—primarily doctors and nurses working in clinical settings.

We evaluated different frontend technologies and platforms, including web apps and cross-platform frameworks. Our goal was to select a technology that aligns with both user preferences and our team’s ability to deliver a high-quality experience.

## 2. Decision

We have decided to build our frontend application using **Swift** and **SwiftUI**, targeting **iOS** devices.

## 3. Rationale

Our decision is based on both technical and user-centered factors:

- **User preference**: Through user research and interviews, we found that doctors and nurses strongly prefer using a **mobile app** on their **iPhone** over a web-based interface. They cited convenience, performance, and integration with their mobile workflow as key reasons.
- **Native performance**: Swift and SwiftUI provide smooth, fast, and responsive experiences, which is critical for applications that play and manage audio recordings.
- **Modern UI development**: SwiftUI allows for faster development with declarative syntax, built-in accessibility, and seamless integration with Apple design patterns.

## 4. Consequences

**Positive outcomes:**
- Delivers a polished, native user experience aligned with user expectations
- Simplifies UI development with SwiftUI’s declarative approach
- Leverages iOS system features and hardware for audio playback and secure data access
- Increases user trust and adoption by offering an experience that feels "professional" and reliable

**Negative outcomes:**
- Limits app availability to iOS devices (at least initially)
- We have not used Swift and SwiftUI, so there will be a learning curve for our software team
- Android support will require a separate codebase if/when needed

## 5. Alternatives Considered

- **Web app**: Rejected based on user feedback—clinical users preferred native mobile apps due to better usability and performance on phones.
- **React Native / Flutter**: Considered for cross-platform development, but we prioritized native performance and UI fidelity over cross-platform reach.

## 6. Related Decisions

- See ADR on Firebase for how the app integrates with authentication and Firestore.
- A future ADR may address cross-platform expansion, including Android.
