# Architecture Decision Record: [Transition to Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3 Plus]

**Status**: [Accepted]

## 1. Context

 Our initial prototype used the standard ESP32-S3 development board. However, the size of the ESP32-S3 dev board created a major constraint for integrating the device into a small shell suitable for clinical or at-home use.

We also wanted to avoid the complexity and cost of designing a custom PCB, as our timeline prioritized rapid prototyping and iteration.
## 2. Decision

We have decided to transition from the standard ESP32-S3 development board to the Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3 Plus.

## 3. Rationale

The Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3 Plus was selected for the following reasons:

Smaller footprint: The XIAO board’s compact size (21 × 17.5 mm) allows it to be directly integrated into our 3D-printed stethoscope housing without requiring a custom PCB.

Built-in features: The Plus variant includes integrated USB-C, battery charging, and flash/RAM (8MB PSRAM, 16MB flash), which are needed for onboard audio buffering and wireless transmission tasks.

Maintains ESP32-S3 architecture: This transition retains compatibility with our existing codebase, libraries, and development tools.


## 4. Consequences

### Positive outcomes:

Enables a complete prototype build within a standard stethoscope form factor.

Avoids custom PCB design during initial development.

Reduces cost and lead time for prototyping iterations.

Maintains ESP32 toolchain and firmware compatibility.

### Negative outcomes:

May require RF tuning or external antenna in final design if extended WiFi range is needed.

Tighter GPIO constraints and mechanical routing limitations may limit future peripheral expansions.

### Process Changes:

Firmware adapted to match the XIAO ESP32S3 Plus pinout.

CAD models for enclosure updated for new board dimensions and connectors.

Charging and power management tested using integrated USB-C and minimal LiPo battery setup.


## 5. Alternatives Considered

LilyGo T7 S3: Technical specs were sufficient, but was ruled out due to sourcing issues—high price, limited availability, and long shipping times.
